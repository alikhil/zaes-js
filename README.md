# zaes-js
AES encryption implementation.

## Attention!
Before you will learn this lib, I **highly recommend** you to go through other aes implementations in js, because I imlemented zaes.js only because other libraries did not meet my requirements. Some of them you can find [here](https://gist.github.com/jo/8619441).
